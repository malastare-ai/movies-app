A Movies Recommender System built with Python. 

Using the IMDB 5000 movie dataset.

Link to dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset

The app can be found at https://movies-recommender-system.herokuapp.com/

A blog regarding the application can be read on https://2series.github.io/post/moviesrecommender/

I used Flask web framework to create the app with python code

### Why Flask?
* Easy to use
* Built in development server and debugger
* Integrated unit testing support
* RESTful request dispatching
* Extensively documented

### Project Structure
This project has four major parts:

create.py - This contains two files for future use--data.csv and numpy matrix
main.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives movies details through GUI or API calls, and runs the application
templates - This folder contains the HTML template
